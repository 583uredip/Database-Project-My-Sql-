The Cryptocurrency Management System involves three main types of users: Admins, Brokers, and Clients. Admins are responsible for managing user accounts, verifying transactions, and ensuring system integrity. Brokers act as intermediaries between clients and the market, assisting in buying and selling cryptocurrencies. Clients can register, deposit funds, buy or sell cryptocurrencies, and monitor their portfolio. Each transaction is recorded with details such as transaction type, amount, date, and involved parties. Cryptocurrencies are maintained with up-to-date information like coin name, symbol, and current price. The system also tracks user balances and provides secure login credentials for all users. This organized structure helps in managing crypto trades efficiently while minimizing fraud and confusion, offering a safe and transparent platform for all participants.
